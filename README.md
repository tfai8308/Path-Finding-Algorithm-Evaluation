# Path-Finding-Algorithm-Evaluation

This program accepts some user-determined number of vertices and creates a connected graph using them in an adjacency list representation.

The objective is to run an Iterative Deepening Depth First Search (IDDFS) and Dijkstra's Algorithm through the graph and determine the amount of time each algorithm
takes to execute when provided a random starting vertex and random ending vertex.
